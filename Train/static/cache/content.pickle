aS'wow, i have arrived.'

aS'no need to watch, pg. more doomsday talk about the end of privacy as we know it :)'

p9
aS'You are a fanboy.'
p10
aS'stay tuned!'
p11
aS'Super smart guys, great tech, great product.'
p12
aS'sadly i did not have time to test my script and there was a bug or i would have for sure had it :('
p13
aS"I think this will go down as one of PG's best and most predictive essays.  It feels as if these changes are all just before the tipping point but close enough that they're going to happen; if they do, it'll be a huge positive for founders and the investors that adapt."
p14
aS"Requiring someone be in a certain place for a certain amount of time is pretty stupid, but it's worth pointing out that it's very difficult to point to successful startups where the founders were telecommuting in the early days.<p>I only care about output, but I think you get significantly more output in certain situations by being in the same room and informally bouncing ideas around or asking for help."
p15
aS"I've had a MacBook Air since the day it originally came out, and it's been my favorite computer ever.  This addresses all of my issues with it.  As long as you don't need extreme computing power, you should get one.  It's one of those cases where being twice as portable makes it ten times as useful."
p16
aS"This is one of the cheeriest buildings I've ever been in.  I remember an automatic mood uptake walking in the door for each weekly dinner."
p17
aS"We're certainly trying to figure out how to make this work the best for businesses.  Certainly helping better utilize resources is part of it, and so is driving repeat visits."
p18
aS'I\'ve sent apologies to the companies that were at all upset, and I apologize again here (and we\'re working to get the companies that are excited about this up and running as soon as possible).  They\'ve been understanding.<p>I think if we use the name of a business in a "Loopt users want a deal at Place X.  If enough users express interest, Loopt will talk to the business owners to try to make it happen" that\'s ok.  But we definitely shouldn\'t imply that a business has given any sort of consent before they have, and we shouldn\'t use their logo or images.'
p19
aS"If we have a lot of users sign up for deals that don't go through, that hurts us a lot.  That's the reason we pre-set the discounts at levels that make sense for each category of business, and why we're reaching out to businesses early in the process.<p>We're taking credit card numbers in the same way Priceline does for name-your-own price deals and Groupon used to when deals might not tip.  Please let me know what your friends say, though."
p20
aS'3 was a major bug.  We\'ve pulled down all deals until we fix that--it should say "pending merchant approval", with an explanation, not a tip counter.'
p21
aS"The reason the Start Fund works is that the terms are so good--uncapped and no discount--that if you're planning to raise money at all, you should take it, and so the investors get a real index, including the potential home runs.<p>These terms are significantly below the mean for the last YC batch, and I'd bet that some of the best startups don't take the deal.  It's a decidedly less clear strategy to invest in only the not-so-good startups in a batch."
p22
aS"Happy to answer any questions I'm able to.  Looking forward to the great stuff we're going to do at Green Dot!"
p23
aS'We realized that to be really successful, we needed to be about finance and payments as well as location--I think the most interesting things will happen when those two come together.  We talked to a number of companies and were most excited about the team and vision at Green Dot.'
p24
aS'not true at all.'
p25
aS"1. yes, although that gave us some advantages as well.<p>2. not for our core loopt app.<p>3. i think in general location services have lost some luster over the last 12/18 months, but i also think a lot of the things that we've been doing--real-time deals, loyalty offers, etc are generating a lot of interest among users and we'll hopefully be able to take that to the next level at green dot."
p26
aS"slow change i'd say, and lots of discussion about it although i was probably the strongest champion."
p27
aS'i think i can answer this but let me double check.'
p28
aS"obviously it's not going to go down as a massive success (although i hope what we do at green dot does!) but i feel pretty good about it.  it's hard for me to put a number on it, though."
p29
aS'yes when the dust settles.'
p30
aS'that is a very long and hopefully interesting post i am still gathering my thoughts on.'
p31
aS"Thank you.  It's a bummer to be so excited for something I've worked hard for and then read haters hating all over the internet.  This brightened up my day; hope we meet in person some day so I can properly say thanks."
p32
aS"Well, it's been a long week and this seems an appropriately crazy way to end it.  It's off by several orders of magnitude.  VentureBeat never called for the story but I'd be happy to speak about it if they'd like to."
p33
aS'One thing that struck me reading this is that many of us from the first batch are still in the YC orbit.  Exec (JKan) and Hipmunk (Steve, Alexis, and Chris) went through YC, and Justin, Emmett, and I are part-time YC partners.'
p34
aS'Good point; we can change it to make it clear you have to be a US resident to open an account but allow registration from other IPs.'
p35
aS"ok, i think we can add the first one fairly easily.  i'll look into the second.  what's the reason for it?  it goes as a debit transaction no matter what.  just so no one can make a purchase without your PIN?"
p36
aS'We think we add a lot of new features, and have a very fair fee schedule.  Check it out and let us know what you think!'
p37
aS"Capital allocation is critical, no question.  I think venture capital is a great thing, but I think it's very different than HFT."
p38
aS'Good point, I could have chosen better anti-science examples--just picked two recent issues that I think are hurting innovation.<p>I think the tech industry magnifies your inherited financial circumstances less than most other industries.'
p39
aS"I actually say that government is bad at picking individual companies to invest in.  I do think infrastructure investments by the government are important; go try to do business in a country where the roads are terrible and the trains don't run on time.  If we had an efficient system for the private markets to do this, it might be better, but we don't right now."
p40
aS"It seems like we agree far, far more than we disagree.<p>All I meant by a high burn is that we are net negative more than a trillion dollars per year.  I believe we probably need more taxes and less spending to solve it (or just a lot of growth).<p>Yes, we should just spend less on healthcare.  We have a broken system right now.<p>I agree that social security has a real problem with the income cap.  I also don't think I said anything about raising the eligibility ages.<p>I also agree that discretionary spending is eseentially irrelevant, and entitlement and defense spending is the issue.  I believe I said this too."
p41
aS"The way to do it is to have a good reputation among founders, and the way to do that is to a) work hard to help the founders you invest in and b) don't screw them.  This becomes very important when the founder you really want to invest in is choosing among lots of offers.<p>Of course, you also have be able to identify the good companies, which I will write about later."
p42
aS"It's much better to invest in a good company at a high price than a bad company at a low price."
p43
aS'You should not join a startup as an early employee (with a correspondingly low salary) for an equity position that will not make you a post-tax millionaire in a 200MM exit.'
p44
aS"I agree, you'd be better off building your product than reading pretty much anything.  Reading HN is rarely the most productive thing you could be doing with your time."
p45
aS'This usually only happens if the company is failing, in which case your stock is close to worthless anyway.'
p46
aS'yes'
p47
aS"If the founders have been working on the company for awhile I'll usually agree to a shorter vesting schedule.  That said, one of my favorite things in the world is when a founder proposes 6-year vesting for a company they've already been working on for awhile to set the right standard for everyone else."
p48
aS"This is intentional.  I believe that secondary markets are usually bad, and always distracting.  I'm not opposed to pre-exit liquidity, but a secondary market that the company does not oversee causes huge issues.  Most companies now prevent this.<p>Your point about ISOs expiring is reasonable--I think a lot of companies are using RSUs partly for this reason."
p49
aS'this is how analytics should be done.  congrats, guys.  proud to be an investor!'
p50
aS"Definitely true--if someone invests a lot of their money, they'll focus.  The problem comes when a 500MM fund makes a 100k investment.<p>YC is somewhat different, since all the investments we make are the same size.  And, I'm biased, but I think we work pretty hard."
p51
aS'Mildy bad things are less common, but very bad things are possible now that were not 50 years ago.  One individual can have a much worse impact.'
p52
aS'I think that&#x27;s totally different than the NSA having them, but yes, I would.<p>It&#x27;s not really the point, though--I can have opinions about whether specific practices are overreaching, but what I really care about is disclosure.'
p53
aS'I agree with that--for example, I think Microsoft Research has some of the smartest hackers I&#x27;ve met.  However, other divisions of MSFT (and where this person was going) have some of the worst people I&#x27;ve met.'
p54
aS'I still said that when I had a negative checking account balance while starting my company.  I think you should worry about money, but that you should take a long-term view of it.'
p55
aS'Depends what you believe will happen with the markets and inflation over the next 15 years.  I believe a better approach in today&#x27;s world is to put yourself in a position where you&#x27;re less dependent on historical market performance.'
p56
aS'Travel is not wasting a year or two; you should do it.  It doesn&#x27;t answer the question of what you should do when you get back.'
p57
aS'The problem is most 19 year olds will spend that money instead of saving it.<p>MS research is pretty awesome.'
p58
aS'It&#x27;s true--I absolutely had a safety net from my parents.  I really didn&#x27;t want to ask them for it, but it undoubtedly affected my decision making.'
p59
aS'ok, last comment on this.<p>this was meant to be more about how to have the biggest impact with your life than how to make a little more money.  and it certainly doesn&#x27;t apply to everyone--hence the title.  many people will me much happier not following it.<p>on the money side, there is nothing wrong with taking a job that pays you $30k more.  most people ramp up their spending and don&#x27;t save that ~$20k (post-tax) extra, but if you do, more power to you.  that $30k will never in your lifetime compound to $100MM, but if that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re shooting for, that&#x27;s obviously fine.  it&#x27;s certainly a much less risky path.'
p60
aS'I specifically carved out enterprise software and developer tools--I think this mostly applies to consumer Internet.<p>As mentioned, Google is a good counterexample.  Groupon and Foursquare very much touch the real world.  I&#x27;d argue Yahoo made a mistake of not being enough in touch with the real world.  Tumblr and Twitter are also reasonable counterexamples, although both were started before I think this trend became very strong.'
p61
aS'Experience itself is usually a good thing; the problem for startups comes when that experience brings with it things that cause issues with the startup--for example, much higher salary requirements.'
p62
aS'Garry is among the best people I&#x27;ve ever worked with--he&#x27;s both a very smart and helpful investor and a great guy.  Extremely well deserved.'
p63
aS'Luck is necessary but not sufficient.  But I left it off the list because telling people to &quot;be lucky&quot; is difficult to act on.'
p64
aS'Three things:<p>1) There are almost certainly a lot of inaccuracies in here.  I saw a few on a quick skim of the article.<p>2) Exponential growth is a hard thing for most people to wrap their minds around.  The best tech investors--many of which invested in this round--understand it.  Most bloggers do not.  The former camp has a better track record on valuing companies like these, although of course a lot of investments don&#x27;t work out.  But I would much prefer to give money to the investors in this round to invest for me than the writers of this article.<p>3) It&#x27;s easier to spew hate than it is to build value.  While bloggers write stuff like this, companies can just ignore it and laugh about it over drinks in a few years.'
p65
aS'For example, the liquidation preference is a standard 1x, not 2x, which is a very important inaccuracy.'
p66
aS'Per my earlier comment, the liquidation preference thing is just completely inaccurate.  And the ~50% growth rate comment is just so insanely inaccurate I&#x27;m not even sure how to respond. (do have a look at this, though: <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/403183731449413632" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;paulg&#x2F;status&#x2F;403183731449413632</a>)<p>I&#x2F;we don&#x27;t hate Pando.  I just think the narrative around this article when it was posted this morning glossed over the legitimate facts the company faces.'
p67
aS'It does not work this way.  You do not get to cite made up numbers with anonymous sources that clearly contradict some public info (e.g. the graph PG tweeted in November) and use that disinformation as an attempt at blackmail to get the company to release its numbers.<p>Flipped around, Stripe would not write a blog post about Pando saying all sorts of wildly wrong things and then say &quot;well if you want to correct us and tell us that your traffic is not dwindling and you&#x27;re not almost out of money, we&#x27;ll give you that opportunity because our goal is to be fair and accurate&quot;.'
p68
aS'Partially because real wages for people making minimum wage are down (I touched on some of the reasons why in the post).  It&#x27;s worse in concentrated rich areas like San Francisco.<p>However, I do think costs have come down in a lot of areas.'
p69
aS'I should clarify what I meant by &quot;decay&quot;--services can continue to grow, but if the quality (defined loosely) goes below a certain point, I think it&#x27;s hard to make them into really valuable businesses.'
p70
aS'these are examples of real need for anonymity, but something like secret would be a bad platform for it.'
p71
aS'don&#x27;t feel guilty. I&#x27;m blogging to practice writing. It surprises me at least as much as you when articles like this do well on HN and makes me feel embarrassed I didn&#x27;t make them better (there are some posts I work really hard on and hope people like, but this was not one of them)'
p72
aS'I\xe2\x80\x99m very excited about this.  YC is the smartest group of people I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever worked with, and I believe that startups are going to be the major driver for innovation and economic growth going forward.<p>I was thinking this morning about what it was like to start a startup in early 2005 and how much it\xe2\x80\x99s changed now.  PG has done a remarkable amount to improve the startup ecosystem for founders\xe2\x80\x94in fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to think of anyone who has done more.<p>(Also, maybe someday soon we\xe2\x80\x99ll make Hacker News work well on mobile :) )'
p73
aS'no i prefer running shoes'
p74
aS':)'
p75
aS'It shouldn&#x27;t be the only way to get a (nonimmigrant in this proposal, incidentally) visa.  But I really do believe it should be one way--it&#x27;s hard to argue that more startups would hurt the economy.<p>I agree with you that there is a level of discomfort inherent in letting investors influence who gets visas, but honestly they know more about what startups have a chance at great success than government officers.'
p76
aS'People seem to be trying to deliberately misunderstand my point.<p>1) I don&#x27;t think this should just be for YC.  I&#x27;m just volunteering to beta test it.  I think we are very likely to show success, which would hopefully open it much more broadly.  But I&#x27;d be very happy to do it together with other investors from the beginning.  I feel that in general investors (YC included) are not doing enough to push this issue.<p>2) I do think that investors should get a say in who gets startup visas.  This is no different than universities, big companies, or even the people who give out Oscars deciding who is qualified to get one.'
p77
aS'I said &quot;we&#x27;re not doing this for diversity&#x27;s sake alone.&quot;  It&#x27;d be terribly unfair to the super qualified people we work with to imply that we were working with them just because we wanted diversity.'
p78
aS'this is one of the many reasons we advise startups not to hire during YC. most startups we work with wait to hire until they have raised enough money to make it reasonably safe to join them.<p>and employees should always ask a startup how much runway they have.  if they won&#x27;t tell you, it&#x27;s a big red flag.'
p79
aS'to make a ton of money, you normally have to create a ton of value.  the best way to do that is usually to change the world in some way, however small.<p>most great founders want to both do something great and to make a lot of money.'
p80
aS'planning to ask about surveillance issues.'
p81
aS'to be super clear: YC is not hosting the event, just lending the office space.  my apartment is far too small.<p>there&#x27;s plenty i think obama has done badly, but i think he&#x27;s done a lot of good things too.  and for the political issues i care most about (all related to startups, pretty much) i think he is likely to help the most.  of course, everyone is welcome to disagree with me on this, and many yc community members do.'
p82
aS'very few people do YC primarily for the money (though, as i said in the post, more money for less equity is definitely better than the opposite!), and whether a company is brand new or 6 months old, we think we can increase their valuation by more than 7%.'
p83
aS'companies can still apply late for the summer.'
p84
aS'I think, especially in emerging markets, merchants will eventually hold bitcoin.'
p85
aS'Nothing in particular.  But as we grow, I think it&#x27;s important we&#x27;re clear about our expectations.  Because the amounts are small and we fund so many companies, we don&#x27;t do much diligence before investing.  So occasionally we&#x27;ll fund someone bad.<p>We&#x27;ve had problems in the past, but only twice that I know of.  We have now funded more than 700 companies, so that seems remarkably low.'
p86
aS'Clearly makes a lot of sense for us :)  I think the other companies in the batch will get a ton out of this.<p>I&#x27;m hopeful Quora will too--as the YC community grows larger, we can help companies in lots of ways, including with things like hiring that are particularly important for later stage companies.'
p87
aS'adam and i talked about it outside of the normal application process'
p88
aS'we did invest.  as a general rule, i think investors shouldn&#x27;t disclose terms, but if the company wants to, fine w&#x2F;me.'
p89
aS'this is one of the more thoughtful pieces i&#x27;ve read on the issue.<p>it&#x27;s obvious to anyone really paying attention the tech industry (and probably most other industries) has been extremely unfair to women.  writing like this--clear on the problem and supportive of people who want to help--is important, but it&#x27;s also important to remember that we all collectively have to act to actually change things.'
p90
aS'seriously?  yes, I&#x27;m saying these women wrote a particularly good letter.  i think its important to praise good work.<p>i didn&#x27;t say anything about &quot;if only all women were this calm and docile when talking about this subject&quot;--that&#x27;s all you.  all i said was that this was particularly good.'
p91
aS'obviously i&#x27;d recuse myself from a vote about me :)  and it&#x27;s a big board anyway.'
p92
aS'board of directors has fiduciary responsibility over an organization, usually approves management plans, determines ceo compensation, etc.<p>our board of overseers is modeled after what universities do.  it should be much lighter touch than a board of directors.'
p93
aS'&quot;i&#x27;m hacking on X, Y, and Z&quot; is a perfectly acceptable response, at least as good as &quot;i work at facebook&quot;.'
p94
aS'oops, i accidentally published an earlier draft.  i added a bit more of my thinking here--my sense is that it would probably lead to less waste than current systems.<p>i&#x27;m also not sure it&#x27;s the right approach, but i haven&#x27;t heard any better ideas yet.'
p95
aS'i am a bull.  i just think that we should talk about what the problems are.  ignoring them is not a good way to fix them.'
p96
aS'kevin is basically just unbelievably good at everything.'
p97
aS'most people seemed to have picked up on this, but we aren&#x27;t looking for a company that wants to have one million _employees_.<p>i can envision a future where a million people drive for uber, or where someone creates a healthcare platform that lets individuals find people who need care, or an education platform that matches up people who want to learn with people who want to each, or...'
p98
aS'We hate asking portfolio companies to do any extra work for us.  They notify all previous investors when they raise more money, so we have that information, but for jobs and revenue we&#x27;d have to ask them to take time to do something that would be helpful for us and not for them.<p>(We may start asking for more company performance stats, since fewer and fewer companies have boards and it&#x27;s valuable for companies to report this frequently.  But that&#x27;d be because we thought it was in the best interest of the companies, not YC.)'
p99
aS'roughly: HN, internal tools, and (soon) external tools'
p100
aS'all YC partners get a share of the profits, and they help allocate the YC pool of money.'
p101
aS'where the definition of confirmed = &quot;an anonymous source says to a semi-accurate publication&quot;.'
p102
aS'it&#x27;s really hard to address everything in one post, and i think the issues around gender and race in tech are pretty different.  (we did include a stat on international founders, many of which are not white.)<p>i don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re playing this on &quot;easy mode&quot;, but i&#x27;m sorry you feel that way.'
p103
aS'we shared the stats on founders born outside the US.  it&#x27;s not a perfect map to race, but it&#x27;s not a bad one either--there are people of all colors in this YC batch.<p>do you really think we are trying to &quot;score points for &#x27;addressing diversity&#x27;&quot;?<p>i had an early draft titled &quot;sexism and startups&quot;, but many people pointed out the last 7 paragraphs apply to racial minorities just as much as women.'
p104
aS'to be clear: i don&#x27;t think seed investing is random.  far from it.  i just think it&#x27;s really important to think independently and take the time to really get to know founders and understand businesses instead of just following other investors.'
p105
aS'in 5 years, when the numbers should be real, i will shared all my aggregate data.<p>the normal warning i give people: seed investing has always been hard, and likely to continue to get harder.  valuations are up on average maybe 3x since i started, and it&#x27;s not clear the companies are 3x more valuable.'
p106
aS'no.  at the stage of YC, we&#x27;re looking for something very different. (though we do try to think independently :) )<p>we put a small amount of money into a large number of companies.  the most important thing is that we not miss a potential huge company; we&#x27;re willing to make a lot of mistakes of inclusion to that end.<p>when you&#x27;re making just a small number of high-dollar bets, you have to handle it very differently.'
p107
aS'this is not worthy of HN and the concept has been touched on many times here.  i only blogged it because it was too long for a tweet and i wanted to reference it in a discussion.  please don&#x27;t upvote.'
p108
aS'combo of a n^2 and 2^n function--i think non-US english speakers call it a double-exponential function.'
p109
aS'to be very clear, we do just try to recruit the best people regardless of race, gender, etc.<p>you have to cast a wide net to do that.'
p110
aS'only in the early years of YC did we require an answer right away.<p>as much time as the founders want has been the unofficial policy for awhile, but i thought it was time to share it.'
p111
aS'the energy and biotech companies that went through YC this summer seemed to have a good experience.  we can often help companies raise very large amounts of capital after YC.'
p112
aS'a lot--i updated the post to reflect this.'
p113
aS'most partners don&#x27;t look at this very much.'
p114
aS'if you are a part-time VC, we are very unlikely to fund you unless you agree to quit in the interview.  it&#x27;s hard to start a startup no matter what, but much more so with a part-time job on the side.'
p115
aS'it&#x27;s online!  don&#x27;t be jealous; watch the talks.'
p116
aS'sorry about that.  going to try to add to the last lecture of the course.'
p117
aS'to state what should be obvious, this was a decision by the company not the investors (also, the company made the decision before the round.)<p>i&#x27;m skeptical of remote work for early-stage startups.  i&#x27;m not religious about it for larger companies; i think it works for some and doesn&#x27;t work for others.  if it works, great.  if it doesn&#x27;t, that&#x27;s fine too.<p>the only thing i felt really strongly about (when yishan explained the challenges they were facing and asked for my advice as a friend and not an investor) was that reddit needed to be super generous to people that were unwilling or unable to move, and i think they have been.'
p118
aS'cool w&#x2F;me!'
p119
aS'the best investors generally offer the cleanest terms. we advise founders to walk away from messy terms.<p>what most investors mean here is not to obsess over small differences in valuation (most good investors don&#x27;t do this either, but some do).'
p120
aS'We expect ethical behavior from our community, and this fell well short of that standard.  Obviously we didn&#x27;t suggest or approve it, but we are still sorry it happened.'
p121
aS'The key difference here now is that billions of people are doing these things and there are emergent behaviors from the ubiquity that are powerful.'
p122
aS'I realize that this sounds non-credible (and it&#x27;s certainly one of the craziest professional things I&#x27;ve ever been a part of), but it&#x27;s actually what happened.<p>Yishan wanted to move the office from SF to Daly City.  The board pushed back but said we&#x27;d agree to it with certain data (we wanted Yishan to figure out how many employees would stay with the company through the move, get a comparison to other market rents, etc.--all questions I think a board should ask when thinking through a major commitment).<p>This is certainly not what I was expecting to be dealing with so quickly after investing in reddit, but we&#x27;ll make the best of it.'
p123
aS'YC partners: 1) recruit startups 2) select startups to fund and 3) advise startups.  probably 90% of our time is in the third category.'
p124
aS'thanks!'
p125
aS'on the contrary, most of my best investments have been in rounds of &lt;$500k.  i&#x27;m more afraid of startups raising megarounds as their initial round.'
p126
aS'for gender, it&#x27;s the entire applicant pool (we ask for gender so that&#x27;s easy to compute.)<p>for race, it&#x27;s a bit harder.  we don&#x27;t ask for it, but we looked through hundreds of videos and made our best guess (it&#x27;s also why we left the number as approximate, as of course there are cases where we got it wrong.)'
p127
aS'more than 10,000. still, definitely small enough for random variance.'
p128
aS'we didn&#x27;t look at this here because we fund a lot of asian and indian founders, and we just don&#x27;t have enough of a sample to look at e.g. native american founders.<p>on things like education level, country of birth, age, etc we&#x27;ve previously looked at and discussed the data and it seems very diverse.'
p129
aS'for last batch, more than 40% of the founders were born outside the US.'
p130
aS'we&#x27;ve talked about this before.  we fund founders of all ages above 18 (though i think the oldest founder in the current batch is 66).  we haven&#x27;t calculated it yet but the median age for this batch is probably in the late 20s, with most founders in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.  the last time i looked, we&#x27;d funded many more founders in their 40s than in their teens.<p>there are a lot of promising 16 and 17 year olds that apply that we can&#x27;t fund, though i think it&#x27;s probably a good thing for them that we can&#x27;t.<p>as we have also discussed before, the majority of the most valuable companies we have funded have been started by founders in their 20s (with exceptions like stripe on the lower side and zenefits on higher side).'
p131
aS'stay tuned.'
p132
aS'Certainly working really hard without an expectation of being compensated it (either with equity or cash) is dumb.  I&#x27;ve argued a lot that startups should give employees more equity, and I think that&#x27;s shifting.  Also, most startups I&#x27;m aware of, at least in the bay area, pay large salaries at this point.'
p133
aS'as you said, it&#x27;s first a and then b.  if you build something a small number of users love, you&#x27;ll find growing is far, far easier than if you don&#x27;t do that first.'
p134
aS'that really is all there is to it.  if you&#x27;ve read enough that all of this strikes you as obvious, then you don&#x27;t need to read anymore--get to work! :)<p>i wrote this because i think it&#x27;s useful for people thinking about startups for the first time to have an outline of the advice all in one place--the startup class i did last fall is good but long.'
p135
aS'i&#x27;d thought about adding something about this but decided it&#x27;s worth a full post.<p>i don&#x27;t think you need very much of a cushion--i.e., 6 months of living expenses saved up is more than most founders have.  but saving up a bit of money before starting a startup is definitely a great thing to do, and if you&#x27;re an engineer willing to live cheaply, shouldn&#x27;t take very long.<p>that said, startups are not the way to optimize for financial stability and not the right choice for everyone.  if i had little money saved up and a family that depended on me, i&#x27;d choose being an engineer at a big company instead of starting a company until i felt i had some safety net in place.'
p136
aS'though i dropped out, i studied AI in college.  i also worked in andrew ng&#x27;s lab.<p>as a current grad student, why do you believe whatever makes us smart cannot be replicated by a computer program?'
p137
aS'&gt;This has basically the highest insanity * prominence of speaker product I&#x27;ve ever seen.<p>Is that two compliments in one? :) I am debating releasing a sort of part 3, which actually could be called &quot;insanity&quot;, but you should save the criticism for that one.'
p138
aS'definitely--it would be great if we could spend more time on interviews.<p>the tradeoff we make for very quick evaluations is that we are able to look at every company that wants to be part of YC with no introduction or connection to us whatsoever.'
p139
aS'The difference between companies and projects is huge.  We look for companies.'
p140
aS'As I often said--it&#x27;s a good thing we don&#x27;t let HN make our investment decisions.'
p141
aS'The great majority of people we fund have no connection to us whatsoever.<p>YC partners do dozens of events every year in the US and dozens more in the rest of the world to reach out to people we don&#x27;t have any connection to.<p>A great idea, product, market, traction, etc. will always carry more weight than anything else.  As much as there is any single secret to YC&#x27;s success (other than not having a coworking space), being willing to talk to people with no connection to us is it.<p>That said, we definitely take note of recommendations from YC founders about great people they&#x27;ve worked with, and we should be upfront about that.<p>Also, we think announcing this will help YC companies recruit, and anything we can do to help YC companies we like to do.'
p142
aS'She walked in to a hot mess of a situation after the previous CEO resigned on the spot and kept the company from falling apart (which I thought was a live concern at the time).  You try doing that some day.'
p143
aS'We may try something in a future iteration to help people meet cofounders.  In the mean time, working a large tech company is a good strategy.'
p144
aS'There&#x27;s no question that having a low personal burn rate is an advantage when it comes to starting a startup.<p>That said, there are a lot of alternatives.  There are more seed funds now than ever before.  One of the reasons we did this program is that we believe there is hole in this part of the market--it feels like there are more people willing to write a $100k check than a $12k check.<p>Practically speaking, we also felt this was where we could make the most impact with dollars we&#x27;re giving away.  $12MM is the price of a small series B, or 1000 YC Fellowships.'
p145
aS'The numbers are pretty small.  Pro rata doesn&#x27;t apply to employee option pool dilution, so it&#x27;s really probably only 5% of a round.  If a VC says they will do an investment if they can own 20% but not 19% of a company, I believe they are lying.'
p146
aS'It is a statement that we believe investing in YC companies at post-YC valuations is still a great deal.'
p147
aS'The math is off here; YC companies have raised more than double that amount.'
p148
aS'We will do it whenever we possibly can--our goal is 100%.  There have been occasional instances where a company doesn&#x27;t get us docs until 3 hours before a close or something.'
p149
aS'Money is among the least useful things YC gives.  There are a lot of ways to get money; good advice and a strong community are very hard to find.'
p150
aS'Advice about how to create a good startup turns out to be more generalizable that I originally thought.  The hardest problems--mostly around people--are more similar than they seem.'
p151
aS'There are a lot of things I love about HN, but seeing the hate on ambition, hard work, and potential success is always disappointing.'
p152
aS'I don&#x27;t know where that statistic came from but it&#x27;s nowhere close to accurate.  Less than half of the startups we funded in the first 5 years of YC have died.<p>Also, he average valuation of all YC startups through w2014 (i.e. with enough time to have raised a first round) is now over $100MM.'
p153
aS'Sure--the vast majority of ideas just can&#x27;t support a multi-billion dollar business.<p>But a lot can, and poor execution is why they don&#x27;t.'
p154
aS'If we are taking the amount of risk I&#x27;d like us to be taking, it should be near 0.'
p155
aS'No, I don&#x27;t.<p>We try to be up front that they have a high chance of failure.  But I truly believe that there is nothing better for their career, technical, and personal growth than doing a startup they&#x27;re passionate about (we try to filter out the people that want to do a startup for a resume item).<p>Also, one of the advantage of YC is that if the startup doesn&#x27;t work out, founders have made a lot of connections in the network and can usually find something interesting to do next.<p>As I&#x27;ve said before, I think the actual risky path is not pursuing what you really want to do and then spending the rest of your life regretting it.'
p156
aS'One of those two things.'
p157
aS'::shudders:: Tri Alpha is not backed by me.<p>Helion is though, which I think has a much better chance of producing commercial fusion power!'
p158
aS'That part I can agree with!'
p159
aS'Honestly if we were prepared to take 320 that would have been good.  The quality was outstanding.'
p160
aS'UPower will be able to use thorium.'
p161
aS'Also, please do not take this as encouragement to start an accelerator.<p>Accelerators on the whole are a terrible business, and we try to be up front about that with everyone who comes to us for advice.'
p162
aS'This is incredibly off in many ways. Someday we will just release our numbers.'
p163
aS'Our IRR was over 100% last time I calculated it; those numbers were really off.'
p164
aS'i think the answer is we should do both.<p>the sad truth is that being poor and being black&#x2F;latino are both disadvantages when it comes to starting a startup in silicon valley.  obviously both are overcome-able, but it&#x27;s an uneven playing field.'
p165
aS'I&#x27;ll come, who can we coordinate with?'
p166
aS'It means YC companies will be able to meet with them one on one and get advice. They get a slice of YC equity in return.'
p167
aS'We just hire whoever we think will be best at advising startups. When they are too well known people complain. When they are not well-known enough people complain.<p>But as long as the startups get good advice I&#x27;m happy.'
p168
aS'I&#x27;m not arguing that people allocate specific income to specific expenses, just that people need and deserve more income.<p>I think Airbnb is well aware of the housing issue and more than willing to work together on solutions.'
p169
aS'Do you have evidence of Airbnb driving up pricing levels?  I&#x27;d honestly love to see it if so.'
p170
aS'We talked to Alan at great lengths in the process of putting this together.  He is the most insightful person I&#x27;ve ever met on how to structure an organization for great research.'
p171
aS'We&#x27;ll have more info on this in a month or so!'
p172
aS'1. SF for now.<p>2. Yes, eventually we&#x27;d like to have multiple groups in the same space just for this reason--I always think the interdisciplinary stuff is underrated.<p>3. Some of both, probably, but mostly we want to support people that the existing system does not support (e.g. people that are not yet famous)'
p173
aS'I was hoping to answer questions here for awhile but I&#x27;m getting pulled into a crisis so I have to go.<p>I&#x27;m going to do an AMA on HN later this week (mostly to answer questions about applying to YC) and would be happy to answer more questions about YCR then.'
